# Overview

The stock deployment is an Java assembly based on the Java Reference Implementation Bare Metal project. It consists of pre-assembled and partly configured instances of core reference implementation components.  The Java Reference Implementation and Bare Metal projects are not intended to be full blown, production ready HISP. Instead it is a starting point from which a production HISP can be derived and deployed.
